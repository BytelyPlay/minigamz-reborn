# The Idea
A bungeecord server with a bungeecord plugin using a custom protocol that uses ProtoBuffers (yes i know that is VERY overkill but it might not be who knows?) to communicate between servers \
Minestom, fabric whatever is used doesn't matter! \
the only thing that DOES matter is EVERYTHING has to be custom-made (libraries are allowed)

# The Protocol
